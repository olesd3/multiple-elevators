Multiple elevators
======================

Latest update: March, 13th
Priority: Initialize network manually so that it is clear what happens when we launch a new elevator after a shutdown.

---

To-Do List:
- Finish handling connections between the elevators
- Make the logic for the master elevator to select one elevator for a job
- Handle the backup part (primary backup storing data)
- Handle the roles change in case of a shutdown
